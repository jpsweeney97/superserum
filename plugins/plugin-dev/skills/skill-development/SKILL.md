# Skill Development for Claude Code Plugins

Structural reference for building skills in Claude Code plugins.

## Related

For the **creation process** (TDD, testing, validation workflow), see the `writing-skills` skill.

For **rigorous skill creation** with analysis, evolution scoring, and synthesis panel, use the `skillcreator` skill or `/plugin-dev:create-skill` command.

## About Skills

Skills are modular packages extending Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge and tools. They transform Claude from general-purpose to specialized by providing procedural knowledge no model fully possesses.

### What Skills Provide

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Workflows | Multi-step procedures | Hook creation flow |
| Integrations | File format / API guidance | MCP configuration |
| Domain expertise | Company-specific knowledge | Business rules, schemas |
| Bundled resources | Scripts, references, assets | Validation utilities |

## Anatomy of a Skill

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description)
│   └── Markdown body
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/      - Executable code (deterministic tasks)
    ├── references/   - Documentation loaded as needed
    ├── examples/     - Working code to copy/adapt
    └── assets/       - Files for output (templates, icons)
```

### SKILL.md (Required)

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `name` | Letters, numbers, hyphens only |
| `description` | When to use (not what it does) |
| Body | Core workflow, quick reference |

### scripts/

Executable code for deterministic or frequently-repeated tasks.

- **When to include:** Same code rewritten repeatedly, deterministic reliability needed
- **Example:** `scripts/validate-hook-schema.sh`
- **Benefits:** Token efficient, may execute without loading into context

### references/

Documentation loaded into context as needed.

- **When to include:** Detailed info Claude should reference while working
- **Examples:** API docs, schemas, patterns, advanced techniques
- **Best practice:** If >10k words, include grep search patterns in SKILL.md

**Avoid duplication:** Content lives in SKILL.md OR references, not both. Prefer references for detail—keeps SKILL.md lean.

### examples/

Working code users copy and adapt.

- **When to include:** Common patterns worth demonstrating
- **Examples:** Complete hook scripts, config files, templates

### assets/

Files for output, not context loading.

- **When to include:** Files used in final output (not documentation)
- **Examples:** Templates, images, fonts, boilerplate

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills use three-level loading to manage context efficiently:

| Level | When Loaded | Size Target |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Metadata (name + description) | Always | ~100 words |
| SKILL.md body | When triggered | 1,500-2,000 words |
| Bundled resources | As needed | Unlimited |

**Key principle:** SKILL.md must be self-sufficient for executing the skill. References provide depth on concepts mentioned in the skill—they answer "tell me more about X," not "what's the next step."

## SKILL.md Structure

```markdown
---
name: Skill-Name
description: Use when [specific triggering conditions]
---

# Skill Name

## Overview
Core principle in 1-2 sentences.

## When to Use
Bullet list with symptoms and use cases.
When NOT to use.

## Core Pattern
Before/after comparison or quick reference table.

## [Workflow Sections]
Step-by-step procedures as needed.

## Common Mistakes
What goes wrong + fixes.

## Resources
Pointers to references/, examples/, scripts/
```

## Description Quality

Descriptions determine when Claude loads the skill. Include:

- Specific trigger phrases in quotes
- Concrete scenarios (symptoms, contexts)
- Related skills for cross-reference

**Format:** Start with "Use when" or "Use for"

```yaml
# Good
description: Use for "skill file structure", "SKILL.md format", "progressive disclosure" patterns, or organizing skill directories.

# Bad
description: Provides guidance for working with skills.
```

## Directory Structure Patterns

### Minimal Skill
```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md
```
For: Simple knowledge, no complex resources

### Standard Skill
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   └── detailed-guide.md
└── examples/
    └── working-example.sh
```
For: Most plugin skills

### Complete Skill
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   ├── patterns.md
│   └── advanced.md
├── examples/
│   ├── example1.sh
│   └── example2.json
└── scripts/
    └── validate.sh
```
For: Complex domains with utilities

## Plugin-Specific Notes

### Location

```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json
└── skills/
    └── my-skill/
        └── SKILL.md
```

### Auto-Discovery

Claude Code automatically:
1. Scans `skills/` directory
2. Finds subdirectories with SKILL.md
3. Loads metadata always, body when triggered

### Testing

```bash
cc --plugin-dir /path/to/plugin
# Ask questions that should trigger the skill
```

## Study These Examples

Plugin-dev's skills demonstrate best practices:

| Skill | Look For |
|-------|----------|
| `hook-development` | Progressive disclosure with 3 validation scripts |
| `agent-development` | AI-assisted generation prompts in references |
| `mcp-integration` | Comprehensive reference files for complex topic |
| `plugin-settings` | Real-world examples from production plugins |
