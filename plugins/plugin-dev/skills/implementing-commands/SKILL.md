# Commands Implementation (Coming in Slice 4)

This skill is planned for a future release.

## Current Status

The plugin development pipeline is being built in vertical slices:
- **Slice 1 (Current):** Skills pipeline (brainstorming-skills, implementing-skills)
- **Slice 2 (Planned):** Hooks pipeline
- **Slice 3 (Planned):** Agents pipeline
- **Slice 4 (Planned):** Commands pipeline

## What To Do Now

For command implementation guidance, use:
1. `/command-development` — Structural reference for commands (frontmatter, arguments)
2. `/implementing-skills` — TDD methodology (applies to commands too)

## When This Will Be Available

This skill will be implemented after brainstorming-commands is complete.
