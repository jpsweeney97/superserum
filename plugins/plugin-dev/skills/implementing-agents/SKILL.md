# Agents Implementation (Coming in Slice 3)

This skill is planned for a future release.

## Current Status

The plugin development pipeline is being built in vertical slices:
- **Slice 1 (Current):** Skills pipeline (brainstorming-skills, implementing-skills)
- **Slice 2 (Planned):** Hooks pipeline
- **Slice 3 (Planned):** Agents pipeline
- **Slice 4 (Planned):** Commands pipeline

## What To Do Now

For agent implementation guidance, use:
1. `/agent-development` — Structural reference for agents (frontmatter, examples, tools)
2. `/implementing-skills` — TDD methodology (applies to agents too)

## When This Will Be Available

This skill will be implemented after brainstorming-agents is complete.
